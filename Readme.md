# PicsMart Project Notes

## Installation

1. First I initialized the project with - `npm init`

2. Then I installed few packages -
```
npm i dotenv nodemon express mongodb mongoose
```

**Now I have created the exact file structure as I had in the MongoDB & Mongoose class.**

Every Project now a days requires an authentication process, so think this project as a very separate entity.
